Rimworld Conflict Checker

Details: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=25305

Please report any bugs either on GitHub, or the Ludeon forum thread.

Usage:

	RCC.exe "<path.to.RimWorldWin.exe>" (optional)"<path.to.steam.mod.folder>"
	
Example:

	RCC.exe "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\RimWorld" \"D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\294100"

or just run RCC.exe to get a folder picker & config saver.
					
Results of the checks are written to file RCC.txt in the executable folder.

RCC uses an opensource library Nbug to submit crashes to a Mantis tracker so I can fix any issues.
